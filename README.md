# CLPlayingCards

This module provides playing cards and classes to manipulate them. It is meant to be used as a component of JavaFX programs that play card games. It currently offers only a poker deck, but it might be interesting to add support for others (UNO, Tarot, etc.).

This module currently is used in the LaBelleLucie project (https://github.com/alantcote/LaBelleLucie).
